This repository demonstrates a common off-by-one error in Rust when manipulating vectors using raw pointers. The `bug.rs` file contains the erroneous code, which directly modifies the vector's data using `as_mut_ptr()`, without sufficient bounds checking. The `bugSolution.rs` offers a safer alternative that avoids this error. This example highlights the potential pitfalls of unsafe code and the importance of robust memory management in Rust.
